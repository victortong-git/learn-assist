# Biology Fundamentals

## Cell Structure

**Basic Cell Parts**
- Cell membrane: Controls what enters and leaves the cell
- Nucleus: Contains DNA, controls cell activities
- Cytoplasm: Jelly-like substance where reactions occur
- Mitochondria: Powerhouse of the cell, makes energy (ATP)

**Plant vs Animal Cells**
- Plant cells have: Cell wall, chloroplasts, large vacuole
- Animal cells have: Small vacuoles, no cell wall or chloroplasts
- Both have: Nucleus, membrane, cytoplasm, mitochondria

## Life Processes

**Photosynthesis (Plants)**
- Formula: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂
- Plants use sunlight to make glucose from carbon dioxide and water
- Produces oxygen as waste product

**Cellular Respiration (All living things)**
- Formula: C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + ATP
- Breaks down glucose to release energy (ATP)
- Uses oxygen, produces carbon dioxide and water

## Genetics Basics

**DNA and Genes**
- DNA: Contains genetic information in chromosomes
- Genes: Sections of DNA that code for traits
- Humans have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs)

**Inheritance**
- Dominant traits: Expressed with one copy (A)
- Recessive traits: Need two copies to be expressed (a)
- Example: Brown eyes (B) dominant over blue eyes (b)

**Genetic Crosses**
- BB × bb → All Bb (all brown eyes)
- Bb × Bb → 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb (3:1 ratio)

## Human Body Systems

**Circulatory System**
- Heart pumps blood through blood vessels
- Carries oxygen, nutrients, and waste
- Red blood cells carry oxygen

**Respiratory System**
- Lungs exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide
- Breathing brings oxygen in, removes carbon dioxide
- Oxygen goes to blood, carbon dioxide removed

**Digestive System**
- Breaks down food into nutrients
- Mouth → Stomach → Small intestine → Large intestine
- Nutrients absorbed in small intestine

**Nervous System**
- Brain and nerves control body functions
- Sends electrical signals throughout body
- Controls movement, senses, and thinking

## Ecology

**Food Chains and Webs**
- Producers: Plants (make their own food)
- Primary consumers: Herbivores (eat plants)
- Secondary consumers: Carnivores (eat herbivores)
- Decomposers: Break down dead organisms

**Energy Flow**
- Energy flows from sun → plants → herbivores → carnivores
- Energy is lost at each level (only 10% passes up)
- Pyramid shape: many producers, fewer top predators
