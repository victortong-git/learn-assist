# Mathematics Learning Guide for Secondary School

## Pre-Algebra and Basic Arithmetic (Grade 6-8)

### Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)
**Remember**: Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally
1. **Parentheses/Brackets** and other grouping symbols first
2. **Exponents/Orders** (powers, roots, absolute value)
3. **Multiplication and Division** (left to right)
4. **Addition and Subtraction** (left to right)

**Examples:**
- 2 + 3 × 4² = 2 + 3 × 16 = 2 + 48 = 50
- (5 + 3) × 2³ ÷ 4 = 8 × 8 ÷ 4 = 64 ÷ 4 = 16
- 12 ÷ 3 × 2 + 1 = 4 × 2 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9

### Integer Operations
**Adding Integers:**
- Same signs: Add and keep the sign (+3 + +5 = +8, -3 + -5 = -8)
- Different signs: Subtract and use sign of larger absolute value (+3 + -5 = -2)

**Subtracting Integers:**
- Change subtraction to adding the opposite: 5 - 8 = 5 + (-8) = -3

**Multiplying/Dividing Integers:**
- Same signs = positive result: (+3)(+4) = +12, (-3)(-4) = +12
- Different signs = negative result: (+3)(-4) = -12, (-3)(+4) = -12

### Fractions and Rational Numbers
**Types of Fractions:**
- **Proper fraction**: Numerator < denominator (3/4, 2/5)
- **Improper fraction**: Numerator ≥ denominator (5/3, 7/4)
- **Mixed number**: Whole number + proper fraction (1 2/3, 3 1/4)

**Converting Between Forms:**
- Improper to mixed: 7/4 = 1 3/4 (divide: 7 ÷ 4 = 1 remainder 3)
- Mixed to improper: 2 3/5 = 13/5 (multiply: 2 × 5 + 3 = 13)

#### Operations with Fractions
**Addition/Subtraction** (Need common denominators):
- Same denominator: 3/8 + 1/8 = 4/8 = 1/2
- Different denominators: 1/4 + 1/6 = 3/12 + 2/12 = 5/12
- Finding LCD: List multiples or use prime factorization

**Multiplication** (Multiply straight across):
- 2/3 × 3/4 = 6/12 = 1/2
- Tip: Cancel common factors first: 2/3 × 3/4 = (2×3)/(3×4) = 1/2

**Division** (Multiply by reciprocal):
- 2/3 ÷ 3/4 = 2/3 × 4/3 = 8/9
- Remember: "Keep, Change, Flip"

### Decimals and Percents
**Converting:**
- Fraction to decimal: Divide numerator by denominator (3/4 = 0.75)
- Decimal to percent: Multiply by 100 (0.75 = 75%)
- Percent to decimal: Divide by 100 (75% = 0.75)

**Percent Problems:**
- Finding percent of a number: 25% of 80 = 0.25 × 80 = 20
- Finding what percent: 15 is what % of 60? 15/60 = 0.25 = 25%
- Finding the whole: 20 is 25% of what? 20 ÷ 0.25 = 80

## Algebra (Grade 8-12)

### Algebraic Foundations
**Key Vocabulary:**
- **Variable**: Letter representing unknown number (x, y, a, b)
- **Coefficient**: Number multiplying a variable (in 3x, coefficient is 3)
- **Constant**: Number without a variable (5, -2, π)
- **Term**: Single mathematical expression (3x, 5, -2y², x/4)
- **Expression**: Combination of terms (3x + 5, 2x² - 4x + 1)
- **Equation**: Expression with equal sign (3x + 5 = 14)

**Properties of Real Numbers:**
- **Commutative**: a + b = b + a, ab = ba
- **Associative**: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c), (ab)c = a(bc)
- **Distributive**: a(b + c) = ab + ac
- **Identity**: a + 0 = a, a × 1 = a
- **Inverse**: a + (-a) = 0, a × (1/a) = 1 (a ≠ 0)

### Linear Equations and Inequalities

#### Solving One-Variable Linear Equations
**Steps:**
1. Distribute and combine like terms
2. Move variables to one side, constants to other
3. Use inverse operations
4. Check your answer

**Examples:**
- Simple: 3x + 5 = 14 → 3x = 9 → x = 3
- Complex: 2(x + 3) - 5 = 3x + 1 → 2x + 6 - 5 = 3x + 1 → 2x + 1 = 3x + 1 → -x = 0 → x = 0

#### Linear Inequalities
**Solving Rules:**
- Same as equations, BUT flip inequality sign when multiplying/dividing by negative
- Example: -2x > 6 → x < -3 (sign flipped!)

**Graphing Solutions:**
- Open circle for < or > (not included)
- Closed circle for ≤ or ≥ (included)
- Shade left for negative direction, right for positive

### Quadratic Equations (Grade 9-11)
**Standard Form**: ax² + bx + c = 0 (where a ≠ 0)

#### Solving Methods
**1. Factoring** (when possible):
- Factor out GCF first
- Look for difference of squares: a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)
- Factor trinomials: x² + bx + c = (x + m)(x + n) where m + n = b and mn = c
- Example: x² + 5x + 6 = 0 → (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0 → x = -2 or x = -3

**2. Quadratic Formula** (always works):
x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a

**3. Completing the Square**:
- Move constant to right side
- Take half of b coefficient, square it, add to both sides
- Factor left side as perfect square

**Discriminant (b² - 4ac):**
- Positive: Two real solutions
- Zero: One real solution (repeated root)
- Negative: No real solutions (complex solutions)

### Systems of Equations (Grade 8-10)
**Three Solution Methods:**

**1. Graphing**: Plot both lines, find intersection point
**2. Substitution**: 
- Solve one equation for one variable
- Substitute into other equation
- Example: y = 2x + 1 and 3x + y = 11 → 3x + (2x + 1) = 11 → 5x = 10 → x = 2, y = 5

**3. Elimination (Addition/Subtraction)**:
- Multiply equations to create opposite coefficients
- Add equations to eliminate one variable
- Example: 2x + 3y = 7 and 4x - 3y = 5 → Add: 6x = 12 → x = 2

### Functions (Grade 8-12)
**Definition**: A relation where each input (x) has exactly one output (y)

**Function Notation**: f(x) = 2x + 3 means "f of x equals 2x plus 3"

**Types of Functions:**
- **Linear**: f(x) = mx + b (straight line, constant rate of change)
- **Quadratic**: f(x) = ax² + bx + c (parabola)
- **Exponential**: f(x) = abˣ (rapid growth/decay)
- **Absolute Value**: f(x) = |x| (V-shaped graph)
