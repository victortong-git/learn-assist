# Mathematics Essentials

## Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)
1. **P**arentheses (or **B**rackets)
2. **E**xponents (or **O**rders)  
3. **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (left to right)
4. **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (left to right)

Example: 3 + 2 × 4² = 3 + 2 × 16 = 3 + 32 = 35

## Basic Algebra

**Solving for x**
- 2x + 5 = 15 → 2x = 10 → x = 5
- 3x - 7 = 8 → 3x = 15 → x = 5

**Common Formulas**
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Area of rectangle = length × width
- Area of circle = π × r²
- Perimeter of rectangle = 2(length + width)

## Fractions

**Adding/Subtracting**
- Same denominator: 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4
- Different denominators: 1/3 + 1/6 = 2/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2

**Multiplying/Dividing**
- Multiply: 2/3 × 3/4 = 6/12 = 1/2
- Divide: 2/3 ÷ 1/4 = 2/3 × 4/1 = 8/3

## Geometry Basics

**Triangles**
- Sum of angles = 180°
- Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c²
- Area = (base × height) ÷ 2

**Circles**
- Circumference = 2πr or πd
- Area = πr²
- π ≈ 3.14

## Percentages

**Conversions**
- 25% = 0.25 = 1/4
- 50% = 0.50 = 1/2
- 75% = 0.75 = 3/4

**Calculations**
- 20% of 60 = 0.20 × 60 = 12
- What % is 15 of 50? = (15/50) × 100 = 30%

## Problem-Solving Steps
1. Read the problem carefully
2. Identify what you know and what you need to find
3. Choose the right formula or method
4. Calculate step by step
5. Check if your answer makes sense
