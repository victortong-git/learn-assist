- **Words between subject and verb**: "The box of chocolates *is* expensive"
- **Indefinite pronouns**: "Everyone *has* homework" (singular); "Both *have* homework" (plural)

### Sentence Structure Problems
- **Run-on sentences**: Fix with periods, semicolons, or conjunctions
  - Wrong: "I studied hard I got an A"
  - Right: "I studied hard, so I got an A"
- **Sentence fragments**: Must have subject AND predicate
  - Wrong: "Because I was late" (incomplete thought)
  - Right: "Because I was late, I missed the bus"
- **Comma splices**: Can't join independent clauses with just a comma
  - Wrong: "It's raining, we should stay inside"

### Pronoun Problems
- **Pronoun case**: "John and I went" (subject); "Give it to John and me" (object)

- **Unclear antecedents**: Make sure pronouns clearly refer to specific nouns

### Common Errors in Formal Writing
