# Physics Fundamentals

## Newton's Laws of Motion

**First Law (Inertia)**
- Objects at rest stay at rest, objects in motion stay in motion
- Unless acted upon by an unbalanced force
- Example: Car keeps moving when brakes are applied to wheels

**Second Law (F = ma)**
- Force = mass × acceleration
- More force = more acceleration
- More mass = less acceleration (for same force)
- Example: Pushing a heavy box requires more force

**Third Law (Action-Reaction)**
- For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction
- Example: When you walk, you push back on ground, ground pushes forward on you

## Forces and Motion

**Types of Forces**
- Gravity: Pulls objects toward Earth (9.8 m/s²)
- Friction: Opposes motion between surfaces
- Normal: Surface pushes back when you press on it
- Applied: Force you apply to move something

**Speed vs Velocity vs Acceleration**
- Speed: How fast (50 km/h)
- Velocity: Speed with direction (50 km/h north)
- Acceleration: Change in velocity over time

## Energy Types

**Kinetic Energy**
- Energy of motion
- KE = ½mv² (mass × velocity squared ÷ 2)
- Example: Moving car, flowing water

**Potential Energy**
- Stored energy
- Gravitational: PE = mgh (mass × gravity × height)
- Example: Water behind dam, stretched spring

**Conservation of Energy**
- Energy cannot be created or destroyed
- Only changes from one form to another
- Example: Roller coaster - potential energy converts to kinetic energy

## Waves and Sound

**Wave Properties**
- Wavelength: Distance between wave peaks
- Frequency: Number of waves per second (Hz)
- Amplitude: Wave height (determines loudness/brightness)

**Sound**
- Travels at 343 m/s in air
- Higher frequency = higher pitch
- Larger amplitude = louder sound

## Electricity Basics

**Electric Current**
- Flow of electric charge (measured in Amperes)
- Voltage: Electric pressure (measured in Volts)
- Resistance: Opposition to current flow (measured in Ohms)

**Ohm's Law: V = I × R**
- Voltage = Current × Resistance
- Example: 12V battery with 3Ω resistance gives 4A current
