# Physics Learning Guide for Secondary School

## Fundamental Concepts (Grade 9-12)

### Measurement and Units
**SI Base Units (International System):**
- **Length**: meter (m) - distance from here to there
- **Mass**: kilogram (kg) - amount of matter in an object
- **Time**: second (s) - duration of events
- **Electric current**: ampere (A) - flow of electric charge
- **Temperature**: kelvin (K) - measure of thermal energy
- **Amount of substance**: mole (mol) - counting atoms/molecules
- **Luminous intensity**: candela (cd) - brightness of light

**Common Derived Units:**
- **Force**: Newton (N) = kg⋅m/s² (push or pull)
- **Energy**: Joule (J) = kg⋅m²/s² (ability to do work)
- **Power**: Watt (W) = J/s (rate of energy transfer)
- **Pressure**: Pascal (Pa) = N/m² (force per unit area)
- **Frequency**: Hertz (Hz) = 1/s (cycles per second)

**Scientific Notation** (for very large/small numbers):
- Speed of light: 3.0 × 10⁸ m/s
- Mass of electron: 9.1 × 10⁻³¹ kg
- Distance to sun: 1.5 × 10¹¹ m

### Scalars vs Vectors - Understanding the Difference
**Scalars** (magnitude only - just a number with units):
- **Speed**: "The car goes 60 mph" (how fast, but not which direction)
- **Mass**: "The box weighs 5 kg"
- **Temperature**: "It's 25°C outside"
- **Energy**: "The battery stores 100 J"
- **Time**: "The race lasted 10 seconds"

**Vectors** (magnitude AND direction - size and which way):
- **Velocity**: "60 mph north" (speed + direction)
- **Displacement**: "5 km east of school"
- **Force**: "10 N downward"
- **Acceleration**: "9.8 m/s² toward Earth's center"

**Vector Addition** (when multiple vectors combine):
- **Same direction**: Add magnitudes (5 N east + 3 N east = 8 N east)
- **Opposite directions**: Subtract (5 N east + 3 N west = 2 N east)
- **Perpendicular**: Use Pythagorean theorem (3 N east + 4 N north = 5 N northeast)

## Mechanics - The Physics of Motion

### Kinematics (Describing Motion) - Grade 9-11

#### Key Motion Concepts
**Position vs. Displacement:**
- **Position**: Where you are (like your address)
- **Displacement**: Change in position (how far you moved from start to finish)
- Example: Walk 3 blocks east, then 2 blocks west → displacement = 1 block east

**Speed vs. Velocity:**
- **Speed**: How fast (scalar) - "I drove 60 mph"
- **Velocity**: How fast AND which direction (vector) - "I drove 60 mph north"
- **Average speed**: Total distance ÷ total time
- **Average velocity**: Total displacement ÷ total time

**Acceleration:**
- **Definition**: Change in velocity over time
- **Units**: m/s² (meters per second per second)
- **Positive acceleration**: Speeding up in positive direction OR slowing down in negative direction
- **Negative acceleration**: Slowing down in positive direction OR speeding up in negative direction

#### Motion Equations (Constant Acceleration Only)
**The Big Four Equations:**
1. **v = u + at** (final velocity)
2. **s = ut + ½at²** (displacement with time)
3. **v² = u² + 2as** (velocity without time)
4. **s = (u + v)t/2** (displacement with average velocity)

**Where:**
- u = initial velocity (starting speed)
- v = final velocity (ending speed)
- a = acceleration (rate of change of velocity)
- t = time (how long motion lasts)
- s = displacement (change in position)

**Problem-Solving Strategy:**
1. List what you know (given values)
2. Identify what you need to find
3. Choose equation with known variables and unknown
4. Substitute and solve
5. Check if answer makes sense

**Example Problem:**
A car accelerates from rest (u = 0) at 2 m/s² for 5 seconds. How far does it travel?
- Given: u = 0, a = 2 m/s², t = 5 s
- Find: s = ?
- Use: s = ut + ½at² = 0(5) + ½(2)(5)² = 0 + 25 = 25 m

#### Projectile Motion (Grade 10-12)
**Key Insight**: Horizontal and vertical motions are independent!

**Horizontal Motion** (no air resistance):
- **No acceleration** (ax = 0)
- **Constant velocity**: vx = vx₀ (stays the same)
- **Position**: x = vx₀t

**Vertical Motion** (gravity only):
- **Constant acceleration**: ay = -g = -9.8 m/s²
- **Velocity**: vy = vy₀ - gt
- **Position**: y = vy₀t - ½gt²

**Important Formulas:**
- **Time to maximum height**: t = vy₀/g
- **Maximum height**: h = vy₀²/(2g)
- **Total flight time**: T = 2vy₀/g (for level ground)
- **Range**: R = vx₀ × T = (v₀²sin(2θ))/g

**Real-World Examples:**
- Basketball shot: Horizontal motion + vertical motion under gravity
- Water from garden hose: Same principles apply
- Cannonball trajectory: Classic projectile motion

### Dynamics (Forces and Newton's Laws) - Grade 9-12

#### Newton's Three Laws - The Foundation of Mechanics

**Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia):**
- **Statement**: An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion at constant velocity, unless acted upon by a net (unbalanced) force
- **What it means**: Objects resist changes in motion - they're "lazy"
- **Examples**: 
  - Book on table stays put until you push it
  - Passenger lurches forward when car suddenly stops
  - Hockey puck slides forever on frictionless ice

**Newton's Second Law (F = ma):**
- **Statement**: The net force on an object equals mass times acceleration
- **Formula**: ΣF = ma (sum of all forces = mass × acceleration)
- **What it means**: 
  - More force → more acceleration
  - More mass → less acceleration (for same force)
  - Direction of acceleration = direction of net force
- **Units**: 1 Newton = 1 kg⋅m/s²

**Newton's Third Law (Action-Reaction):**
- **Statement**: For every action force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force
- **Important**: Action and reaction forces act on DIFFERENT objects
- **Examples**:
  - You push wall → wall pushes back on you
  - Earth pulls you down → you pull Earth up
  - Rocket burns fuel down → hot gases push rocket up

#### Common Forces in Physics

**Weight (Gravitational Force):**
- **Formula**: W = mg
- **Where**: m = mass (kg), g = 9.8 m/s² (acceleration due to gravity)
- **Direction**: Always toward Earth's center
- **Note**: Weight and mass are different! Mass is amount of matter, weight is gravitational force

**Normal Force (N):**
- **Definition**: Contact force perpendicular to surface
- **Examples**: Floor pushing up on your feet, wall pushing on leaning ladder
- **On level surface**: N = mg (balances weight)
- **On incline**: N = mg cos(θ)

**Friction Force:**
- **Static friction**: Prevents motion when objects try to slide
  - Formula: fs ≤ μsN (less than or equal to max static friction)
- **Kinetic friction**: Opposes motion when objects are sliding
  - Formula: fk = μkN (always equals kinetic friction)
- **Direction**: Always opposes motion (or attempted motion)
- **Coefficients**: μs > μk (harder to start moving than keep moving)

**Tension Force:**
- **Definition**: Force transmitted through rope, string, or cable
- **Direction**: Always pulls along the rope
- **In rope**: Same tension throughout (if rope is massless)
- **Multiple ropes**: Can have different tensions

**Spring Force (Hooke's Law):**
- **Formula**: F = -kx
- **Where**: k = spring constant (stiffness), x = displacement from equilibrium
- **Negative sign**: Force opposes displacement (restoring force)
- **Stiffer spring**: Larger k value

#### Free Body Diagrams (FBDs)
**Steps to Draw FBD:**
1. **Isolate the object** (draw it alone)
2. **Identify all forces** acting ON the object
3. **Draw force vectors** from center of object
4. **Label each force** with magnitude and direction
5. **Don't include forces the object exerts** on other things

#### Problem-Solving with Newton's Laws
**General Strategy:**
1. **Draw free body diagram**
2. **Choose coordinate system** (x and y directions)
3. **Apply Newton's Second Law**: ΣFx = max, ΣFy = may
4. **Solve system of equations**
5. **Check answer reasonableness**
